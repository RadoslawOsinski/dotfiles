I was testing some additional functionality that is available for security on Java EE 6 and EE 7 platforms. One item that is extremely important for all developers is avoiding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues. This can normally be handled very easily by adding http-onlyto your web.xml configuration.


<session-config>
    <session-timeout>30</session-timeout>
    <cookie-config>
        <http-only>true</http-only>
    </cookie-config>
</session-config>
