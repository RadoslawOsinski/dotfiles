1. Generate the private/public key pair with the following command:

gpg2 --full-gen-key


This will spawn a series of questions. The first question is which algorithm can be used.  Select the kind you want
or press Enter to choose the default (RSA and RSA):

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 1


The next question is key length. We recommend to choose the highest value
which is 4096:

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits


Next, you need to specify the validity period of your key. This is something
subjective, and you can use the default value which is to never expire:

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all


Confirm that the answers you gave were correct by typing y:

Is this correct? (y/N) y


Enter you real name, the email address to be associated with this key (should
match a verified email address you use in GitLab) and an optional comment
(press Enter to skip):

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Mr. Robot
Email address: mr@robot.sh
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Mr. Robot <mr@robot.sh>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O

Pick a strong password when asked and type it twice to confirm.

Use the following command to list the private GPG key you just created:

gpg2 --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG mr@robot.sh
Replace mr@robot.sh with the email address you entered above.


Copy the GPG key ID that starts with sec. In the following example, that's
30F2B65B9246B6CA:

sec   rsa4096/30F2B65B9246B6CA 2017-08-18 [SC]
      D5E4F29F3275DC0CDA8FFC8730F2B65B9246B6CA
uid                   [ultimate] Mr. Robot <mr@robot.sh>
ssb   rsa4096/B7ABC0813E4028C0 2017-08-18 [E]


Export the public key of that ID (replace your key ID from the previous step):

gpg --armor --export 30F2B65B9246B6CA
