Associating your GPG key with Git

After you have created your GPG key and added it to your account, it's time to tell Git which key to use.
Use the following command to list the private GPG key you just created:

gpg2 --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG mr@robot.sh
Replace mr@robot.sh with the email address you entered above.


Copy the GPG key ID that starts with sec. In the following example, that's
30F2B65B9246B6CA:

sec   rsa4096/30F2B65B9246B6CA 2017-08-18 [SC]
      D5E4F29F3275DC0CDA8FFC8730F2B65B9246B6CA
uid                   [ultimate] Mr. Robot <mr@robot.sh>
ssb   rsa4096/B7ABC0813E4028C0 2017-08-18 [E]


Tell Git to use that key to sign the commits:

git config --global user.signingkey 30F2B65B9246B6CA
Replace 30F2B65B9246B6CA with your GPG key ID.
